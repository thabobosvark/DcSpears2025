## Overview  
(NOT COMPLETE)  
This repository documents our progress during the CHPC 2025 Student Cluster Competition training.  
Our goal was to design, deploy, and automate a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster using IBM Cloud and DigitalOcean after being reassigned from Google Cloud due to credit issues.
